%  <N> is a 2-D array each row of which is a histogram.  Returns
%  the statistical significance level for concluding that there is a
%  difference between the various rows (i.e. the probability that the 
%  differences from the mean histogram for each bin would be greater than
%  or equal to the given values if the row didn't matter). 
%
%  If <userules> is 1, then the following rules of thumb are applied and
%  cause NaN to be returned if they are violated:
%  (a)  no expected value for a category should be less than 1 (it does not
%  matter what the observed values are)
%  (b)  no more than one-fifth of expected values should be less than 5
%  <userules> defaults to false.
%  Note that NaN is also returned if any of the elements of <N> is NaN.
%
%  If <userules> is 2, then categories (i.e. columns) are automatically
%  merged s.t. the rules are met, or if that is impossible, NaN is
%  returned.  If merge was successful, <colsMrgdA> contains the indices of
%  the original input columns that were merged to satisfy rule (a), and
%  <colsMrgdB> is a 2 column matrix containing the pair of columns of the
%  working array merged at each iteration to satisfy rule (b).  In either
%  case, the newly merged column is placed at the end of the array.
%  <colsNotMrgd> contains the original column indices of any columns in the
%  input <N> that did NOT participate in a merge. <finalCols> is a cell row
%  vector with one one element for each bin; each element contains a row
%  vector of the original column numbers that went into the corresponding
%  bin.
%
%  Also note that this does not reduce to a 1-D chi^2 test if you give it a
%  single column; use dg_chi2test2 for that.

% TRESS gives a lousy description of Degrees of Freedom; a different angle
% is given at http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/A42408.html as "the number of
% independent scores that go into the estimate minus the number of
% parameters estimated as intermediate steps".  In our case, the parameters
% are the marginal probabilities <rowP> and <columnP>; since the marginals
% along any given axis must always total to 1, the last one is not
% independent, so the number of independent marginals is the number of rows
% minus one plus the number of columns minus one.  To calculate our
% expected counts we also need one further independent parameter calculated
% from the data, which is the grand total number of observations,
% sum(sum(N)).  So our degrees of freedom are:
df = numel(N) - (size(N,1) + size(N,2) - 2) - 1;

% Calculate the chi^2 estimate:
if df == 1
    % Use Yates correction
    diffs = abs(N - expected) - 0.5;
else
    % No Yates correction
    diffs = N - expected;
end
addends = (diffs .^ 2) ./ expected;
chi2 = sum(sum(addends));
significance = 1-chi2cdf(chi2,df);
